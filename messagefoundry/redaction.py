"""PHI redaction for the exception/logging path (WP-6c; ASVS 16.2.5, PHI.md P1-3).

Inbound HL7 is attacker-/PHI-bearing, and a Router/Handler is user code that can do
``raise ValueError(f"bad value in {raw}")`` — which would otherwise carry the full message body into
the stored ``last_error``/``message_events.detail`` and any log line built from it. :func:`safe_exc`
is the **chokepoint**: every exception rendered into a stored disposition or a log is routed through
it, so HL7-structured content is scrubbed while the exception **type** (the useful, non-PHI part) is
kept.

This is a conservative *redaction* of HL7-shaped content — **not** de-identification (that is a
separate, centralized framework; see PHI.md §9). It errs toward over-redaction. Beyond HL7-shaped
spans it also applies a **conservative free-text heuristic** (date/DOB runs + multi-token name runs;
see :func:`redact`), so a delimiter-free leak like ``raise ValueError("patient DOE JANE dob 1980-05-05
not found")`` is narrowed too. The residual is now an adversarially-crafted *single-token* or non-name-
shaped identifier, for which the "never put PHI in an exception message" convention remains the control.
Pure stdlib (``re`` only), so it can be used from any engine package.

_REDACTED = "[redacted]"
#: Max characters of a (redacted) exception message to keep — a raw HL7 body is long, so bound what
#: reaches a stored ``last_error`` or a log line even after redaction.
_DEFAULT_LIMIT = 200

#: An HL7 **segment** span: a 3-char segment ID (``MSH``/``PID``/``OBX``/…) immediately followed by the
#: field separator and field data to end-of-line. Catches a raw message (or fragment) embedded in an
#: exception — the realistic vector. The segment ID is kept (not PHI, useful); the field data is cut.
_HL7_SEGMENT = re.compile(r"\b([A-Z][A-Z0-9]{2})\|[^\r\n]*")
#: A run carrying **≥2 HL7 delimiters** (``| ^ ~ &``) — a field/component dump like ``100^^^H^MR`` or
#: ``DOE^JANE^M`` that may be PHI even without a segment header. The non-delimiter runs use **possessive**
#: quantifiers (``*+``, Python 3.11+): the char classes are disjoint from the delimiters, so possessive
#: matching can't change *what* matches, but it makes the scan **linear** — a long delimiter-free run
#: (e.g. ``"a"*5000`` in a hostile exception string) can't trigger quadratic backtracking.
_HL7_FIELD_RUN = re.compile(r"[^\s|^~&]*+[|^~&][^\s|^~&]*+(?:[|^~&][^\s|^~&]*+)+")

#: A **date / birthdate run** in free text: an ISO ``YYYY-MM-DD`` / US ``MM-DD-YYYY`` (``-`` or ``/``
#: separator) or a bare HL7 8-digit ``YYYYMMDD``. A DOB is a direct identifier, and a free-text leak like
#: ``"... dob 1980-05-05 ..."`` carries no HL7 delimiter, so :func:`_HL7_FIELD_RUN` misses it. The
#: alternatives use fixed-width digit runs (no unbounded repetition), so the scan stays linear.
_DATE_RUN = re.compile(
    r"\b\d{4}[-/]\d{1,2}[-/]\d{1,2}\b|\b\d{1,2}[-/]\d{1,2}[-/]\d{4}\b|\b(?:19|20)\d{6}\b"
)
#: A **multi-token name run**: 2–4 adjacent ``Capitalized`` (a capital then lowercase) *or* ``ALLCAPS``
#: tokens — e.g. ``DOE JANE`` / ``Doe Jane``. Requiring **≥2** adjacent tokens is deliberate: a single
#: capitalized operational word (``Connection``, ``Timeout``, ``ValueError``, a logger/class name) is
#: NOT touched, so ordinary ops text survives; CamelCase-without-a-space is likewise untouched. Bounded
#: ``{1,3}`` repetition over disjoint char classes keeps the scan linear (no catastrophic backtracking),
#: mirroring the linear-scan rationale on :data:`_HL7_FIELD_RUN`. The literal ``[redacted]`` token can
#: never re-match (its lowercase-led ``[redacted]`` is a single token wrapped in brackets, not a ≥2-token
#: run), so :func:`redact` stays a fixed point.
_NAME_RUN = re.compile(r"\b[A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s+[A-Z][a-z]+){1,3}\b|\b[A-Z]{2,}(?:\s+[A-Z]{2,}){1,3}\b")
