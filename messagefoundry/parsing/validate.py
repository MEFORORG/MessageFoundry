"""Strict, version-aware HL7 v2 validation — the opt-in tier.

Built on ``hl7apy``, which knows the official HL7 message structures per version and
checks segment cardinality, datatypes, table values and lengths. It is slower and far
stricter than :mod:`~messagefoundry.parsing.peek`, so it runs only when a channel sets
``validation.strict = true`` and is kept off the routing hot path.

``hl7apy`` raises on the *first* problem it finds, which is exactly what a strict channel
needs: one conformance error is enough to NACK. We surface that single message rather
than writing a full multi-error report to disk — a report file of a PHI message is a
data-leak we don't want by default. (Full reporting can become an explicit, opt-in,
redaction-aware feature later.)

# documented as "reserved for a conformance-profile object (Phase 2+); passing one today is
# accepted but not yet enforced" -- accepted by every call and read by none. That is a
# control-shaped parameter that is not a control: a Handler author who passed a conformance
# profile would reasonably believe conformance was being checked, and nothing at runtime would
# have told them otherwise. ``object | None`` accepts anything, so strict mypy could not warn
# them either. Measured across the tree on 2026-09-06: ZERO call sites passed it, against a
# positive control of 13 sites passing the sibling ``expected_version=``, so deleting it broke
# no caller. The roadmap commitment is not lost -- a persisted message-definition model plus a
# conformance validator is BACKLOG #78, demand-gated -- and when that lands it should add a
# TYPED parameter rather than restore an untyped placeholder.
