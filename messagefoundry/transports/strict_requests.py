"""Read a ``requests`` reply through :mod:`~messagefoundry.transports.bounded_read` (BACKLOG #2053).

The engine's three Vault and OpenBao clients (``config/secretprovider_vault.py``,
``store/keyprovider_vault.py`` and ``store/crypto_transit.py``, which shares the second one's
client) talk HTTP through ``hvac``, which talks through ``requests`` and ``urllib3``. None of that
stack went through ``bounded_read``, so on a first deployment a Vault reply would be read with no
byte bound, with ``urllib3``'s own chunk decoder (``int(line, 16)``), and with whatever framing
``http.client`` settled on after a malformed header line (ASVS 4.2.1, 15.2.2).

:class:`StrictReplyAdapter` is a ``requests`` transport adapter. :func:`mount_strict_reply_adapter`
puts it on the session ``hvac`` built, AFTER ``hvac.Client`` is constructed, so the TLS arguments
the suite assertion checked (``tls_policy.assert_hvac_tls_suites``) are still the ones the hop
uses: the adapter subclasses ``HTTPAdapter`` and changes nothing about how ``urllib3`` builds its
pool or its TLS context. It changes only how the reply BODY is read:

* The body is read eagerly, in :meth:`StrictReplyAdapter.build_response`, from the
  ``http.client.HTTPResponse`` under ``urllib3``'s response, by
  :func:`~messagefoundry.transports.bounded_read.read_bounded`. So the framing checks, the strict
  chunk decoder and the byte bound all apply, and ``urllib3``'s own body reader never runs.
* Each request asks for ``Accept-Encoding: identity`` and a reply with any other content coding is
  refused. ``requests`` would otherwise decompress ``gzip`` or ``deflate`` after the bound, so the
  bound would limit the wire bytes and not what the engine buffers.

**Connection reuse stays, and only a strictly complete read earns it** (the row's third limb).
The Transit cipher makes one Vault call per at-rest cell it encrypts or decrypts, so dropping reuse
would add a TLS handshake to every cell. After a clean read the body has ended exactly where its own
framing said, so the stream sits at the next reply's first byte and the connection goes back to the
pool. After ANY refusal, a body past the bound, a truncation or a framing fault, the connection is
closed rather than pooled, because its stream position is then unknown. What reuse still concedes:
a peer that sends MORE bytes than it framed. Extra bytes that arrive with the reply land in that
reply's own buffered reader and are dropped when it closes. Extra bytes already waiting on the
socket when the connection is next taken make ``urllib3`` discard it. Extra bytes that arrive later
than that would be read as the next reply. Only the peer itself, or an on-path writer on a hop with
no TLS, can send them, and either can already forge any reply outright. So reuse adds no capability
that the hop does not already concede.

**A socket failure during the eager read is raised as the** ``requests`` **exception it would have
been.** ``requests`` calls ``build_response`` outside the ``try`` that translates socket errors, so
a stall or reset mid-body would otherwise escape as a bare :class:`TimeoutError` or
:class:`OSError`.

#: Ceiling on one reply body on the Vault or OpenBao Transit client.
#:
#: **Deliberately larger than** ``bounded_read.DEFAULT_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`` **(16 MiB).** A Transit
#: ``encrypt`` or ``decrypt`` reply carries one stored cell as base64, which is 4/3 of the cell, and
#: a cell can be a whole message up to that same 16 MiB. So the shared ceiling would refuse an honest
#: reply for any message past about 12 MiB. 64 MiB is twice the 32 MiB that Vault and OpenBao accept
#: as a request body by default (the listener's ``max_request_size``). A Transit reply is about the
#: size of the request it answers, so every reply to a request those servers accept at their
#: defaults fits, with room for the JSON around it. A site that raises both the engine's message cap
#: and Vault's request cap past that would see the largest cells refused, which fails closed.
