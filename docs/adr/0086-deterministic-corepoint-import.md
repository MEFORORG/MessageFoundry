# ADR 0086 — Deterministic Corepoint action-list import → code-first Handlers

*(final ADR number assigned at merge — placeholder to avoid multisession churn)*

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-10) — owner-ratified for BACKLOG #105 under the #26 amendment; the engine
importer + CLI + synthetic fixtures may build. The input schema is **SYNTHETIC-until-validated** (§2) —
reconcile against a real Corepoint export before any production migration.
**Deciders:** owner + IDE/DX working group
**Related:** BACKLOG **#105** (this build), **ADR 0076** (the typed action vocabulary + action-list lens
this is the *inverse* of), **#26 amendment** (the narrow structured-action-list carve-out both operate
under), ADR 0035 (IDE workspace-trust — the optional `ide/` wrapper shells the CLI under the exec gate),
CLAUDE.md §5/§8 (untrusted config/HL7 as data), §9 (PHI — the importer touches no message content),
§12 (the bright line: `.py` stays the only artifact + execution path).

## 1. Context — importing a Corepoint interface without a canvas

Corepoint's approachability comes from a **typed action-list** (ADR 0076 §1): an interface analyst
builds a transform as an ordered list of typed actions (`ItemCopy`, `ItemReplace`, `ItemFormatDate`,
`ItemCodeLookup`, `ItemSplit`, segment ops, …). ADR 0076 already ships the *read* direction — the
**lens** projects a vocabulary-authored Python Handler back into that action-list. #105 is the **write**
direction of the same bridge: mechanically translate a Corepoint export **forward** into a real
code-first `@router`/`@handler` module, so a shop migrating off Corepoint gets diffable, reviewable
Python instead of hand-retyping every channel.

Two hard constraints frame the decision:

1. **No real export exists in this repository.** The #87 Corepoint recon corpus is git-ignored (it
   carries partner/site data — kept private, never published), so we cannot pin the import schema
   against a captured artifact here. Building against it would either leak customer data or block the
   lane indefinitely.
2. **The bright line (#26 / ADR 0076 §2).** The output must be a plain `.py` file that is the **only**
   artifact and the **only** execution path — no interpreter, no declarative model, no canvas.

## 2. Decision

Build a **pure, stdlib-only engine importer** (`messagefoundry/corepoint_import.py`) + an `import`
CLI subcommand that parses a Corepoint action-list **export** and emits one code-first config module
per channel. The grammar lives in the engine beside the vocabulary + lens (ADR 0076 §5 "grammar in one
place"); the `ide/` wrapper is a thin, optional CLI shell (deferred / out of scope for the Python-only
build lane).

### (a) The export input format — SYNTHETIC-until-validated

Because no real export is available (§1.1), this ADR **defines** a plausible JSON model and states
honestly that it is unvalidated. A real Corepoint export will need a reconciliation pass (field names,
nesting, action-class inventory) before production use; the parser is deliberately isolated so only it
changes when the real shape is known.

```jsonc
{
  "format": "corepoint-actionlist",
  "version": 1,
  "channels": [
    {
      "name": "ACME_ADT",
      "inbound":  { "connector": "mllp", "name": "IB_ACME_ADT", "port": 2600 },
      "destinations": [
        { "name": "OB_ACME_ADT", "connector": "mllp", "host": "10.20.30.40", "port": 6000 }
      ],
      "handlers": [
        { "name": "acme_adt_transform",
          "destinations": ["OB_ACME_ADT"],          // optional; defaults to all channel destinations
          "actions": [
            { "class": "ItemCopy", "source": "PID-5.1", "destination": "NK1-2.1" },
            { "class": "ItemReplace", "target": "MSH-6", "value": "ACME" }
            // …
          ] }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

`connector` is `mllp` (inbound: `port`; outbound: `host` + `port`) or `file` (`directory` [+ `filename`]).
The importer treats every value as **untrusted data**: each value lifted into generated source is
rendered through `json.dumps`, whose fully-escaped literal cannot break out into executable code
(CLAUDE.md §5/§8). No new dependency — `json` parse + string codegen only.

### (b) The action → vocabulary mapping (the INVERSE of ADR 0076 §2)

| Corepoint action class | v1 vocabulary call (`messagefoundry/actions.py`) |
|---|---|
| `ItemCopy` | `copy_field(msg, source, destination)` |
| `ItemReplace` | `set_field(msg, target, value)` |
| `ItemAppend` | `append_to_field(msg, target, suffix)` |
| `ItemFormatDate` / `ItemTransformDate` | `format_date(msg, target, outputFormat, in_fmt=inputFormat?)` |
| `ItemConvert` / `ItemFormat` | `convert_case(msg, target, mode)` |
| `ItemCodeLookup` | `code_lookup(msg, target, table, default=default?)` |
| `ItemSplit` | `split_field(msg, source, separator, destinations)` |
| `SegmentCopy` / `ItemSegmentCopy` | `copy_segment(msg, segment, occurrence=occurrence?)` |
| `SegmentDelete` / `ItemSegmentDelete` | `delete_segment(msg, segment)` |

Each emitted handler runs its mapped calls, then `return Send(...)` (one destination), `return [Send(...), …]`
(several), or `return None` (no destination — a filter). The router forwards to every handler with a
`# TODO: Corepoint routing` marker to refine by hand.

### (c) Unmapped actions are never silently dropped (count-and-log)

An action whose `class` has no v1 mapping emits, **in place**, an
`# TODO: Corepoint <ActionClass> — hand-finish` marker plus a best-effort field-preserving
`msg.set(<target>, msg.field(<target>) or "")` passthrough stub when a target field is recoverable.
The import summary counts mapped vs. unmapped actions per channel (the count-and-log ethos, CLAUDE.md
§1). In the lens round-trip the stub degrades to a single in-place `code` row — never a whole-file
refusal.

## 3. Acceptance criteria

- **AC-1 (mapping)** — WHERE an export action has a v1 mapping, the importer SHALL emit the
  corresponding vocabulary call with the exported field paths as arguments.
  → `tests/test_corepoint_import.py::test_maps_every_vocabulary_class`
- **AC-2 (count-and-log)** — WHERE an export action has no mapping, the importer SHALL emit an in-place
  `# TODO: Corepoint …` marker (+ best-effort stub) and count it — never drop it silently.
  → `tests/test_corepoint_import.py::test_unmapped_action_is_stubbed_not_dropped`
- **AC-3 (check gate)** — the emitted modules SHALL pass `messagefoundry check` (validate leg).
  → `tests/test_corepoint_import.py::test_generated_module_passes_check`
- **AC-4 (lens round-trip)** — every emitted `@handler` SHALL classify through `lens parse` into typed
  rows with no whole-file refusal; mapped calls become `action`/`lookup` rows, the `return` a `send` row.
  → `tests/test_lens_parse.py::test_generated_handler_round_trips_through_lens`
- **AC-5 (untrusted input)** — a hostile value (quotes/newlines/backslashes) SHALL ride across as an
  inert literal, never injected code; a malformed export SHALL raise `CorepointImportError`, not a
  traceback. → `tests/test_corepoint_import.py::test_hostile_values_are_escaped_not_injected`,
  `::test_malformed_export_raises`

## 4. Consequences

- **Positive:** a migrating shop gets first-class, reviewable Python; the vocabulary/lens/import bridge
  is symmetric (one grammar); stdlib-only, no new dependency, no PHI surface (no message content).
- **Negative / residual:** the input schema is synthetic — a real export reconciliation is required
  before production migration (isolated to the parser). Routing is not reverse-engineered (forwards to
  all handlers with a TODO). The optional `ide/src/corepointImport.ts` wrapper is deferred (the engine
  importer + CLI + tests are the deliverable).
