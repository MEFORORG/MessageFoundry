# ADR 0076 — Typed action vocabulary + structured action-list lens over Python Handlers

**Status:** Accepted (2026-07-10) — ratified by the owner 2026-07-10; the PLAN-8 lanes may build. Gating rule: **phase 1 (the vocabulary) requires only the #26-amendment merge; phases 2–3 require this ADR Accepted.** In practice phase 1 builds after Acceptance anyway — its v1 roster is fixed by §2 and MULTISESSION-PLAN-8 bundles it with phase 2a in one lane.
**Deciders:** owner + IDE/DX working group
**Related:** BACKLOG **#222** (this build), **#26 amendment** (the narrow carve-out this ADR operates under), **#221** (sibling IDE-polish lane), the deep-research findings ([`docs/research/ide-low-code-options.md`](../research/ide-low-code-options.md) — verified precedents: InterSystems low-code custom editors, Kaoto/Karavan/AWS Workflow Studio, Iguana annotations, Corepoint action-lists), ADR 0007/0033/0014 (the sanctioned config-as-data GUIs), ADR 0072 (traced dry-run — the live values rendered beside action rows), ADR 0010/0043 (`db_lookup`/`fhir_lookup` — the sanctioned read-only lookups the lens renders as DBSelect-style rows), ADR 0035 (IDE workspace-trust — `lens` CLI calls are exec-gated like every CLI call), CLAUDE.md §9 (PHI), §12 (the amended bright line).
Plan: [`docs/releases/MULTISESSION-PLAN-8.md`](../releases/MULTISESSION-PLAN-8.md) (L2 builds phases 1+2a; L3 builds phase 2b; L4 = phase 3, owner-gated).

## 1. Context — the analyst gap, and the line we must not cross

MessageFoundry's authoring is code-first Python by design (#26). The 2026-07-10 deep-research verified the two halves of the analyst problem: **Corepoint's approachability comes from typed actions** (a structured, non-visual action-list editor practitioners confirm non-programmer HL7 analysts run production interfaces on), and **its documented frustration is having no code underneath in-product** ("felt a bit fenced in", "seemingly simple tasks took lots of steps"). Iguana — the code-first analog — wins on **making code legible** (live per-line annotations), which MessageFoundry now ships (#92 v1/v2, ADR 0072). The remaining gap is the typed-action layer: an enterprise HL7 interface analyst who doesn't know Python cannot yet read or safely edit a Handler.

The round-trip literature verified in the same research draws the boundary: **structural constructs round-trip; behavioral code does not** (hand edits that break a generated pattern cannot be reverse-engineered; protected regions cannot guarantee hand edits survive). InterSystems ships the working guardrail set for exactly this shape inside VS Code: custom editor over the real document, **sync on save only**, **one editor at a time**, **graceful fallback to the text editor**.

## 2. Decision

Build, in phases, a **typed action vocabulary** (plain Python helpers) and a **structured action-list lens** — a VS Code custom editor that renders any *parseable* Handler: typed rows for vocabulary code, in-place read-only `code` rows for everything else, whole-file refusal only on parse failure (§4). The `.py` file remains the **only artifact and the only execution path** — the lens is a projection of real code, never a stored model. There is **no runtime interpreter, no declarative artifact, no canvas**: that is what keeps the #26 rationale (diffable, reviewable, version-controlled config) fully intact.

### Phase 1 — the vocabulary (`messagefoundry/actions.py`, engine, no IDE dependency)

Small composable helpers mirroring the Corepoint action classes, mapped onto the existing mutable
[`Message`](../../messagefoundry/parsing/message.py) API (`field`/`__getitem__`, `set`/`__setitem__`,
`add_repetition`, `add_segment`, `delete_segments`, `repetitions`, `groups`):

| v1 helper | Corepoint analog | Maps to |
|---|---|---|
| `copy_field(msg, src, dst)` | ItemCopy | read `src` path → `msg.set(dst, …)` |
| `set_field(msg, path, value)` | ItemReplace | `msg.set(path, value)` |
| `append_to_field(msg, path, suffix)` | ItemAppend | read + `msg.set` |
| `format_date(msg, path, out_fmt, *, in_fmt=None)` | ItemFormatDate / ItemTransformDate | parse/reformat TS values |
| `convert_case(msg, path, mode)` | ItemFormat / ItemConvert | upper/lower/title |
| `split_field(msg, src, sep, dests)` | ItemSplit | read, split, `msg.set` each |
| `code_lookup(msg, path, table, *, default=…)` | ItemCodeLookup | translation tables (ADR 0033 code sets) |
| `copy_segment(msg, …)` / `delete_segment(msg, seg_id)` | segment ops | `add_segment` / `delete_segments` |

Rules: helpers are **pure** (message in-place mutation only, no I/O — the reliability invariant is untouched); fully type-hinted, mypy-strict, SPDX-headed; exported on the `messagefoundry` authoring surface; the existing `db_lookup`/`fhir_lookup` are *not* wrapped — the lens recognizes them directly (DBSelect analog). Control flow is **native Python** (`if`/`elif`/`else`, `for` over `msg.groups()`/segments) — the vocabulary deliberately adds **no** flow wrappers, so vocabulary-authored handlers read as ordinary idiomatic code. The v1 roster above is finalized at phase-1 build from the Corepoint tab inventory (owner screenshots, 2026-07-10) + the #87 recon; **widening the roster is an ordinary addition, widening the *grammar* (§4) requires amending this ADR.**

Standalone value: the vocabulary immediately becomes the target for Insert Element snippets, completion, `@messagefoundry` codegen, and wizard scaffolds — with or without the lens.

### Phase 2 — `lens parse` (engine CLI) + the read-only action-list editor (IDE)

- **`messagefoundry lens parse <module.py> --json`** — a **static** `ast` parse (stdlib only, **never imports or executes** the config module) that classifies each `@handler` body into the row contract of §3. Engine-owned so the grammar lives in one place beside the vocabulary; the IDE consumes the JSON contract only (the ADR 0072 L5/L6 split, repeated).
- **IDE custom editor** (`CustomTextEditorProvider` over the Handler `.py`): renders rows as a Corepoint-style ordered, nested action-list view with parameter forms, an in-editor toolbar, and Test (Test Bench inline). Entry is **opt-in**: a "Reopen in Action-List view" CodeLens on `@handler` defs + a command (the InterSystems pattern) — **not** the default editor for `.py` (Python files broadly belong to the user's Python tooling). Live-debug values (ADR 0072 — PHI-redacted by default, synthetic samples only) render beside rows via the existing #92 lanes.

### Phase 3 — editing (separately gated: phase-2 bake + owner go)

Row edits/inserts/deletes/moves become **row-scoped line splices** of the same file (`lens rewrite`, §5): only the edited row's lines are regenerated from the row template; every other byte is untouched. Saves go through the normal `TextDocument`/`WorkspaceEdit` path.

## 3. The action-list contract (v1)

`lens parse` emits, per `@handler` (routers are **out of v1 scope**):

```
{ "handler": "<registered name>", "module": "<path>", "def_line": <int>,
  "rows": [
    { "kind": "action",  "action": "copy_field", "params": {"src": "PID-5.1", "dst": "NK1-2.1"},
      "line_start": <int>, "line_end": <int>, "nesting": <int> },
    { "kind": "lookup",  "call": "db_lookup" | "fhir_lookup" | "code_lookup", "params": {…}, … },
    { "kind": "control", "control": "if" | "elif" | "else" | "for",
      "test_src": "<verbatim source>", "recognized": true|false, … },
    { "kind": "send",    "outbounds": ["OB_…"], … },
    { "kind": "code",    "line_start": <int>, "line_end": <int> }        // verbatim, unrecognized
  ] }
```

**Coverage invariant (load-bearing):** the rows' line ranges **exactly partition** the def body — every line is in exactly one row; nothing is dropped, reordered, or synthesized. An unparseable *file* is a lens refusal (the IDE stays in/steps aside to the text editor), not a guess.

## 4. Recognition grammar + the degradation ladder

Recognized rows are deliberately **bounded** (the structural subset that round-trips):

- **action/lookup rows** — single expression-statements calling the v1 vocabulary (or `db_lookup`/`fhir_lookup`/`code_lookup`) with literal args or bounded `Message`-read expressions (`msg["…"]`, `msg.field(…)`).
- **control rows** — `if/elif/else` whose test is a bounded expression (Message reads, comparisons, boolean ops, string methods over them, literals), and `for` over `msg.groups(…)`/segment iterations; bodies are nested row sequences.
- **send rows** — `return Send(…)` / list-of-`Send` returns.
- **everything else** — a **`code` row**: rendered *in place, in order* in the list as read-only code. This is the key UX decision: one hand-written line does **not** eject the whole handler from the lens; it appears as an opaque-but-visible step between typed rows (degradation ladder: typed row → code row → whole-file refusal only on parse failure).

## 5. Rewrite semantics + PHI (the load-bearing correctness section)

- **Row-scoped splice, never reformat.** `lens rewrite` regenerates only the edited/inserted row's line range from its template; untouched rows/blank lines/comments are byte-preserved (test gate §6.2). No AST unparse of the whole file (stdlib `ast.unparse` discards formatting/comments — rejected); no `libcst` in v1 (new runtime dep, DEP-1 — revisit only if splicing proves brittle, as an ADR amendment).
- **Sync on save only; one editor at a time; update-loop guard; Reopen With: Python always available** — the verified InterSystems/VS Code guardrail set, adopted wholesale.
- **Static analysis only.** `lens parse`/`rewrite` never import or execute config modules — a module whose top level would raise still parses. No message content is involved at all in parse/rewrite; **PHI enters only via the live-value annotations, which reuse the ADR 0072 stream and its `--show-phi` gate unchanged** — the lens adds no second PHI gate and no persisted artifact.
- **IDE trust:** the lens shells the CLI, so it inherits the ADR 0035 workspace-trust exec gate like every other extension CLI call.

## 6. Consequences + test gates (acceptance criteria)

1. **Coverage property:** for a corpus including every `samples/config` handler + adversarial hand-written handlers, `lens parse` row ranges exactly partition each def body; unrecognized constructs appear as `code` rows in position — never dropped/reordered.
2. **Byte-stability (phase 3 — tests `lens rewrite`, which does not exist until then):** parse → no-op rewrite is **byte-identical** for the whole corpus; a single-row edit changes only that row's line range.
3. **Emitted code is first-class:** rewritten files pass `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy` (strict), and `messagefoundry check` on the samples corpus.
4. **Static-only:** a config module with a top-level `raise` parses successfully (proves no import/execution).
5. **Vocabulary purity:** `actions.py` helpers do no I/O (enforced by review + a no-new-imports test); SPDX header present; **no new runtime dependency** in phases 1–2 (stdlib `ast` only); crypto-inventory gate not tripped (no crypto imports).
6. **IDE:** lens editor degrades to the text editor on parse failure with a notice; edits sync on save only; live values render redacted unless the existing show-PHI opt-in is set (never auto-enabled).

Two-way door: if the lens disappoints, phase 1's vocabulary remains independently valuable and nothing else in the product depends on the lens.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The `lens parse` row ranges SHALL exactly partition each `@handler` def body, with unrecognized constructs emitted as in-place `code` rows — never dropped, reordered, or synthesized → test refs added by the L2 build (coverage-partition property over `samples/config` + adversarial handlers).
- `lens parse`/`lens rewrite` SHALL never import or execute a config module; a module whose top level would raise SHALL still parse → L2 test ref.
- Vocabulary helpers SHALL perform no I/O and SHALL pass `ruff` + `mypy --strict`; phases 1–2 SHALL add no new runtime dependency → L2 test ref + review gate.
- Rewritten files (phase 3) SHALL be byte-identical outside the edited row's line range, and SHALL pass `ruff check`, `ruff format --check`, `mypy --strict`, and `messagefoundry check` on the samples corpus → L4 test refs.
- The IDE lens SHALL degrade to the text editor on parse failure with a notice, SHALL sync edits on save only, and SHALL render live values redacted unless the existing show-PHI opt-in is explicitly set (never auto-enabled) → L3 test refs.

## 7. Alternatives considered

- **Declarative action artifact (a TOML/YAML action-list executed by the engine)** — rejected: a second execution path and a stored non-Python logic artifact is precisely #26's declined pattern; it also forfeits the Python escape hatch that the verified Corepoint testimony shows analysts eventually hit.
- **Full-Python projection (render any handler as rows)** — rejected: behavioral round-trip is the verified failure mode; the bounded grammar + code rows is the honest subset.
- **`libcst`-based rewriting** — deferred (dep + DEP-1 cost vs. the splice approach; revisit via ADR amendment if splicing proves brittle).
- **Notebook (`.ipynb`) authoring surface** — rejected for authoring (a second artifact format); the notebook *rendering* fork stays a #92-side presentation question.
- **Standalone designer / Theia studio** — rejected for now per the research §7 ranking (parked exit path; nothing here is stranded by a later move since the lens is a custom editor over files).

## Addendum (2026-07-10): live-value acquisition (BACKLOG #225)

Phase 2b shipped the lens with the live-value slot **stubbed** (each row rendered the redacted placeholder; no values were fetched). This addendum records how the shipped lens actually obtains those per-row values, wiring #225.

**Decision.** The lens acquires live values by shelling a **second traced dry-run** — `messagefoundry dryrun --trace json` (ADR 0072) — against a chosen **synthetic** sample, and folds the result onto rows. Concretely: the provider runs the trace, filters the invocations to the open module (`invocationsForFile`), folds the per-line assigned locals + `msg[...]` writes into inline annotations (`traceRowValues`), and attaches them to rows by **line containment** via the already-tested `mergeLiveValues` (a trace event on 0-based line *n* belongs to the row whose 1-based `[line_start, line_end]` contains *n+1*).

**Sample selection** reuses the Test Bench's existing pattern — an open dialog defaulting to `messageSetsDir`, `.hl7`-filtered — surfaced as a lens toolbar control ("Pick Sample…"); the pick is remembered and reused across the open lens editors. No new sample manager is introduced.

**Dirty-buffer alignment (skip while unsaved).** The trace reads the module **from disk**, but the rows are projected from the **live buffer** (`lens parse -` over stdin). After an unsaved **structural** edit (insert/delete/move) the buffer's rows shift relative to disk, so the disk trace's line numbers describe the pre-edit file; mapping them onto the shifted rows by line containment would attach a marker to the **wrong row**. A dry-run cannot reflect an unsaved buffer, so the lens **skips** live values while `document.isDirty` (`shouldAttachLiveValues`) — the redacted placeholder stands — and **re-attaches** them on the next save, when `disk == buffer` realigns the coordinates. This is the same "sync on save" guardrail the projection itself follows.

**Rejected alternative — reading `LiveDebugController`'s last-trace state.** The #92 live-debug controller already holds a last trace in memory, so the lens could have read it directly. Rejected: it **couples the lens to the controller's internal state**, and it **only works when live-debug is already toggled on** (the lens must annotate whether or not the user has enabled the live loop). A self-contained second dry-run keeps the lens independent; the extra dry-run is a dev-time preview cost, not a hot path.

**PHI posture — reuses ADR 0072's `--show-phi` redaction gate, adds no second gate, persists nothing (CLAUDE.md §9):**
- **Redacted by default.** The lens's trace argv **never contains `--show-phi`** (`buildLensTraceArgs` cannot emit it), so the CLI redacts every captured value at the source; the fold renders the same `▸ ⋯` placeholder the #92 inline path uses. This is the same redaction gate as live-debug — not a new one.
- **Never auto-reveal.** The fold defaults `reveal` off and the provider **always** calls it off; nothing in the lens flips it on or auto-passes `--show-phi`. (A future reveal control, if added, must match live-debug's separate, off-by-default, per-session "reveal values" convention exactly.)
- **Never persisted.** The trace JSON is consumed **in-memory over stdout** — there is no on-disk trace artifact to leak or accidentally commit.
- **Synthetic only.** The picker defaults to `messageSetsDir` (PHI-free corpora); tests use synthetic samples exclusively.
- **Graceful, never an error.** No sample picked, an exec-gated (untrusted) workspace, or a failed/empty trace all yield no values — the rows carry none and the toolbar's redacted placeholder stands; a live-value failure is never surfaced as an error.
